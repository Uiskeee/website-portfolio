            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Web dev Ruined Me, so I did game dev to improve my Well-Being, which I will refer to as WBRMSIDGDTIMWB, is 
                a 2D Resource Management Game.
                <br>
                In WBRMSIDGDTIMWB, users play as a game development student with 3 assignments due in 15 days. Players are must try
                to manage their energy, sustanence, motivation and stress as they try to complete these assignments, shown as minigames.
                <br>
                <br>
                Failing to manage these stats will cause debuffs for the player such as loss of controls and screen distortion effects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project is a serious game for student health sustainability, done by a team of 4 developers over a span of 2 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Game Designer: Designed the core principles of the game </li>
                <li>Gameplay Programmer: Developed systems such as the dialogue, post processing shaders and player controls</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge for me was trying to use post processing shaders when I had never touched them before this point.
            </p>

            <h2>Tools Used</h2>
            <p>C#, Unity</p>
