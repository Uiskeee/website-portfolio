            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                CakeCakeCake! is a 2D party game where players play as the characters Strawberry, Tiramisu, Lemon or Cookies & Cream and
                partake in a series of minigames where winning means getting a cake!
                Players must race to stack 3 cakes in order to win.
                <br>
                CakeCakeCake! draws inspiration from Mario Party for its gameplay and Paper Mario for its cute, papery artstyle.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It was made for my final year project over a span of 3 months, in a team of 5, including 2 artists.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Manager: Assigned work and managed communication between artists and developers.</li>
                <li>Lead Gameplay Programmer: Developed the game's core systems and gameplay</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge was shaping together a functional framework that would fit our needs for the game.
