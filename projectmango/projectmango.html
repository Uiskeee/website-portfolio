            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Project Mango is a third person 3D action game where users play as Mango, a vigilante in a cyberpunk world. He 
                is infected with a virus and must reach the end of a facility and slay the head of it in order to cure himself before
                it completely takes over his system and kills him.
                <br>
                <br>
                Players run through randomly generated rooms with various enemies, gaining more strength through either unique augments,
                which give special abilities or permenant stat gains.
                <br>
                Players can also find meta progression through a unique skill tree system.
            </p>

                <br>
            <p>
                This project was done in a team of 4 developers and 6 artists over a span of 2 weeks.
            </p>

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Gameplay Programmer: Developed systems such as combat, movement, 3D model & animation integration</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                Not really technical, but as this was our first time working with artists, we had to overcome challenges such as
                understanding artist scopes and integrating assets across different software.
            </p>

            <h2>Tools Used</h2>
            <p>C#, Unity 3D</p>
