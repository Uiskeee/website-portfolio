            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Scaling Dungeons is a 3D Rougelite deckbuilder FPS where the player's weapon of choice are throwing cards!
                <br>
                Players must traverse through a randomly generated dungeon, encountering different enemies, encounters and items.
                <br>
                <br>
                They must make use of the items and experience they gather to attach them to their throwing cards and gain new skills
                such that they'll be strong enough to beat a final boss at the end of this dungeon. 
                <br>
                Take too long and enemies might just get too strong for them.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This was made for my specialisation project, which is a 6 month solo project, done alongside
                other assignments for modules.
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                The main challenge for this project was not technical, but was scoping appropriately as this was my first ever
                long term project.
            </p>

            <h2>Tools Used</h2>
            <p>Unity 3D, C#, HLSL</p>
